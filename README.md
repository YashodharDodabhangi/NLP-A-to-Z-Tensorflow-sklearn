# NLP-A-to-Z-Tensorflow-sklearn
Here I am putting the all the work related to NLP from scratch to advanced (Only coding part )

1.Text Pre-processing.(Working with Regex)
  i.remove punctions,stop words,tokenzation,stemming
  ii.text Normalization
  
2.NLP encoding techniques,
    one-hot-encoding,Bag of words,TF-idf,WordtoVec,Weighted_wordtoVec,Word_embdedding,Text Augumation.
    
3.classification using Naive-bayes.

4.Web-scraping of text data

5.Working with textfiles and pdf and dataframes(pandas and pyspark).

6.EDA of text data using Pandas and pysaprk.

7.Working with API(flask).

8.Working NLP libraries.(NLTK,Gensim,)

9.Build the model for varies application using ML and DL on some dataset.
  i.Rnn and 1-D cnn
  ii.LSTM
  iii.GRU

10.SeqtoSeq Model on some dataset

11.Attention mechanisms
  i.Transformers.
  ii.BERT.
  
12.Build the casestudy/Work on live project
  example:
  chatbot,bigtextdata classfication,QnA system,Text Summarization.Speach recognition.
